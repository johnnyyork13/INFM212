        <p id="aboutPara">Hello! My name is Johnny York and I am currently a junior
            in Mercer's Software Application Development and Human-Computer Interaction program. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I completed my associate's degree in Computer Support at Georgia Northwestern Technical
             College in 2013 and have since been employed as a Communications Technician with one
             of the major cable providers. 
            <br>
            <br>
            At the beginning of last year I decided I wanted to finally pursue my passion 
            in programming, so I began self-teaching through various bootcamps and online
            courses. Eventually, I decided to commit myself to completing my bachelor's degree which
            led me to Mercer University.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am very excited for this course, and I can't wait to practice and grow my abilities. Thanks!
