                <p>Antoni Gaudi's incredible buildings bring millions of tourists to Barcelona each year.</p>
                <p>Gaudi's non-conformity, already visible in his teenage years, couopled with his quiet but firm devotion to the church, made a unique foundation for his thoughts and ideas. His search for
                    simplicity, based on his careful observations of nature, is quite apparent in his work, from the <a href="dummy link">Park Guell</a> and its incredible sculptures and mosaics, to
                    the Church of the <a href="dummy link">Sarcred Family</a> and its organic, bulbous towers.
                </p>
                <h2 id="sagarda-familia" lang="es">La Sagrada Familia</h2>
                <p><img src="../../images/towers.jpeg" style="width: 75px; height: 100;" alt="Sagrada Familia Towers"> The complicatedly named and curiously unfinished masterpiece that is the Expiatory Temple of
                the Sacred Family is the most visited building in Barcelona. In it, Gaudi combines his vision of nature and architecture with his devotion to
            his faith. The Sagrada Familia attracts even the non-religious to its doors in large part due to its tragic story and its still unfinished state, of which the everpresent scaffolding and
        cranes are permanent reminderes.</p>
                <h2 id="park-guell">Park Guell</h2>
                <img src="../../images/park.jpeg" alt="Park Guell" style="width: 75px; height: 100px;">
                <p>The Park Guell always reminds me of Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's <a href="dummy link"><em>The Foundainhead</em></a>. Gaudi's project in the Park Guell was to build a residential
                community whose residents would love where they lived. It was never finished. </p>
                <p>Perhaps that is for the beset, since now we <em>all</em> get to enjoy it, The Park Guell is set
                on a hill overlooking practically all of Barcelona. Its beautiful and even comfortable serpentine bench is filed with foreginers and locals
            alike every day of the week. Its mosaic lizards have become synonymous with the city itself.</p>
