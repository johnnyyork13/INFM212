            <h2>MyNextLvl Task List</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Kita wants to create an account.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was able to simulate account creation on the frontend, but there needs to be a database and backend services in order
                            to faciliate true account creation functionality. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Currently, when the user clicks on the create account button, the user is directed to the HIPAA agreement page and a 
                            placeholder account is displayed. </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Kita wants to access her medical condition information.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was able to include all of the medical information on the website. All Kita must do is click the health conditions
                            tab to view the relevant health information. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Kita would like local and non-local resources to be available.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have included pages for both local and non-local resources. The prototype did not include any relevant data for 
                            me to provide detailed information, but the pages are present for future implementation. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Kita would like to be able to cancel and reschedule her doctor's appointments and reminders.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kita can do this by clicking on the reminder dropdown list in the navigation bar and selecting 'Doctor Appointment'.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Kita would like to completely remove doctor's appointments and reminders.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This can be accessed after Kita 
                            logs in and clicks the reminders dropdown list in the navigation bar and selecting 'Doctor Appointment'. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Kita would like to add/edit/remove her prescription reminders.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The functionality to add/edit/remove prescription reminders is displayed on the medication page. To access this she must
                            be logged in. Then Kita can navigate to the reminders dropdown list in the navigation bar and select 'Medication Refill'.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Kita would like to add/edit/remove doctors from her user profile.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have included a page to allow Kita to add and edit her primary care physician. The page is located in her user profile under 'Primary Care Physician'.
                    </ul>
                <li>Henry would like to add/edit/remove his insurance information.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Henry is able to access and edit his insurance information by logging into his profile and selecting the 'Medical Insurance Information' button. </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Henry would like to add/edit/remove his emergency contact information.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Henry can view and edit his emergency contact information by logging into his profile and selecting 'Emergency Contact Information'.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Henry wants information about local affordable healthcare.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was able to include a local and non-local resource link in the 'Resources' dropdown list. Currently, there was no data provided
                            by the prototype that explicitly states it is for affordable healthcare, but this functionality can be added easily to the resources section in the future. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Henry wants information about HIPAA.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The prototype provided a HIPAA agreement section when a new user is creating an account. There is currently no direct link 
                            to view HIPAA regulations and standards. For now, Henry will have to navigate to an external site to view this.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Henry wants to add or edit his allergy information.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Henry can access and edit his allergy information by logging in and selecting the 'Allergies Information' button on his profile page.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Summary:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most of the requested functionality has been implemented on the frontend, but none of the changes a user makes will persist 
                            until a working backend with a database is implemented.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There needs to be a HIPAA regulation information page implemented for the user to access.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The local and non-local resources should be updated to include affordable healthcare.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All of the user account functionality is currently a test account. Once a backend is established, 
                            the user will be able to create and edit account specific details.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>
