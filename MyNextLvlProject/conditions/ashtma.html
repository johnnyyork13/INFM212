                    <p>Asthma is a disease that affects your lungs. It causes repeated episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Asthma can be controlled by taking medicine and avoiding the triggers that can cause an attack. You must also remove the triggers in your environment that can make your asthma worse.</p>

                <h3>Signs of an asthma attack</h3>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to asthma triggers. Your asthma triggers can be very different from someone elseâ€™s asthma triggers. A trigger is something you are sensitive to that makes your airways become inflamed. This causes swelling, mucous production and narrowing in your airways.</p>
