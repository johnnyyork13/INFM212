            <div class="box">
                <p>Sickle Cell Disease is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders that is present from birth. Healthy red blood cells are round and move easily through small blood vessels to carry oxygen throughout the body. However, in someone who has sickle cell disease, the red blood cells become hard and sticky, and have a C-shape, like a farmer’s sickle. The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells called anemia. </p>

                <p>Sickle cell disease is a complex disease. Good quality medical care from doctors and nurses who know a lot about the disease can help prevent some serious problems.
