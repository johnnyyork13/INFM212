                    <p>Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time. Children with CF also suffer from digestive problems that prevent the body from breaking down and absorbing food, leading to inadequate growth and nutrition.</p>
